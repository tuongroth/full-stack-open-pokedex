Modern vs. Traditional CI Setup  

When setting up Continuous Integration (CI), the choice between modern cloud-based solutions and traditional self-hosted systems depends on your project’s needs, resources, and priorities.  

Modern CI solutions like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and GitLab CI (Cloud) offer ease of use and scalability. They handle infrastructure, making them ideal for fast-paced teams focusing on development rather than system management. These tools work well with common linting, testing, and building tasks using tools like ESLint, Jest, or Webpack. However, they require reliable internet, may raise security concerns for sensitive data, and can become expensive for large-scale projects.  

Traditional CI systems like Jenkins or GitLab CI (Self-Hosted) give you full control over the environment. This makes them great for secure, highly customized setups where sensitive data or offline operation is critical. However, they require more effort for setup, maintenance, and scalability, which might strain small teams.  

In short, modern CI is best for flexibility and speed, while traditional CI suits teams prioritizing control and data security. Choose based on your project’s size, budget, and technical requirements.
